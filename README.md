# Gender Pay Gap Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes gender pay gap data to uncover trends and insights about wage disparities. The goal is to better understand factors influencing pay gaps and to develop predictive insights based on clustering and other statistical techniques. The primary objectives of my analysis are to identify trends in the gender pay gap and perform clustering analysis to discover potential patterns among different demographic and geographic groups. Questions to be answered include how has the gender pay gap evolved over time across different countries? Which industries exhibit the largest gender pay gap disparities? Are there common characteristics among regions with the lowest gender pay gaps? How do education and experience levels affect the gender pay gap?
